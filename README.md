# Trade Hounds coding challenge

Thanks for taking the time to share your React Native expertise with us! The point of this test is to help us get an understanding of how you approach architecting a react/redux application and is designed to be completed in four hours. At a high level, you will be building a simple instagram-style dog photo feed with the ability to mark a dog as a favorite. We will be using the [Dog API](https://docs.thedogapi.com/). Once completed, we will meet to talk about your approach and talk about future optimizations you would made given extra time.

The application is managed by [expo](https://docs.expo.io/), and the only dependency you should need to install is the [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/). Alternatively, you can create your own expo snack and work in the expo editor where you would be able to see live changes to the app and share the results using a link. Javascript apps built with expo are designed to run on both native and web, so you have the option of viewing your code changes in either a web or mobile context. The expo syntax is still react-native though, so you use `<View />`, `<Text />`, etc.

#### Getting Started
- To work locally using your own editor, install the [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) by running `npm install -g expo-cli`. When you're finished, feel free to uninstall the cli.
- To work using the online expo snack editor,
